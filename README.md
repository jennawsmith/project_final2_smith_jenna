### Resources

* [Adobe Forum for > symbol](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2156252)
I used this resource because I had the greater than symbol used for my text link and it was giving me errors in Atom, so I used the &gt; instead thanks to this forum.

* [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?q=pub+food&safe=strict&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS708US710&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiI4_uh-OPUAhUBcSYKHQceBU0Q_AUICygC&biw=1292&bih=672#imgrc=_)
I used google images to find the couple of pictures of food.

* [Box Shadow](http://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow)
I used this resource to help me add the box shadow to my buttons for the hover effect.

* [Nav Bar Overlay](http://www.codingforums.com/html-and-css/341639-put-transparent-navigation-bar-top-header-background.html)
I used this site to figure out how to overlay my nav bar on the header background image.

Other than that, I did not use any other resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.


### Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

### Comments

Just wanted to make you aware because I know you'll see it, I did use a max-height on the images because I wanted them to all be the same height when they were aligned along the bottom, I set the width to auto so it wouldn't skew the photo. I typically wouldn't do this, but for the simple purposes of having a few example photos, I thought it looked better like that.
